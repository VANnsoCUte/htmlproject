                    I started studying when I was five years old. I went to kindergarten and elementary at Burgos Memorial School West. 
                    I graduated high school at Ilocos Sur National High School. 
                    I am now a third-year college student at University of Northern Philippines and currently aiming to graduate my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (CS) in the near future.

                    My favorite sports is basketball. When I have nothing to do I play Mobile Legends, Valorant and read bibles, books, and articles to have more knowledge. 
                    I also love surfing the internet, opening my accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
                    I can also play instruments like guitar, piano, bass, and drums. I love to spend time with my family and friends. 
                    I like to watch movies like cartoons movies and horror movies. 
                    I also have a girlfriend and her name is Valerie Tagaban, she is so smart and we are at the same age and also studying  at University of Northern Philippines and and a BS InfoTech student.

                    When I was a kid my mom’s auntie adopted me because my father’s mom said she doesn’t like a grandson, she wanted a granddaughter and that is why my mom’s auntie adopted me. 
                    I still talk to my real parents when it is necessary. 
                    Yes, I forgive them about what they did to me when I was a kid. Someday, when I will be getting a job, 
                    I will still give support to my real family because I love them so much. But I’m still happy with my family right now because without them I’m nothing. 
                    I am very thankful to God because he gave me my lola (mom's auntie) because she took care of me when I was still a baby and until now and she is the sweetest mother and a best mother in the world for me because she always provides all I want and need. When I was sick, she took care of me. Someday I will be taking care of her and I will be giving everything she wants like how she treated me when I was still a child until I grew up to where i am now. I will be giving back the care and love she made me feel.

                <p>
                    Life without God is nothing. And because of family I knew how it felt to be loved, wanted and cared. 
                    I encountered many problems but those are just small steps. Small steps that I take every day so 
                    I'll just look back and I will know how far I've come. And I reflected and learned from all my mistakes.

                    Someday, if it is God's will, I will be part of the cyber security. I’m very thankful for who I am now. 
                    I don’t think too much, I just do what makes me happy.</p>
