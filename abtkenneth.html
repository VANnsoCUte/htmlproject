                    Hi, I'm John Kenneth R. Superable. My parents derived my name from the bible. John means "graced by God," while Kenneth means 
                    "handsome. I'm from Cabittaogan Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur and I'm 20 years old. I was born on January 28, 2002, 
                    here in Ilocos Sur. My parents are Michael Angelo R. Superable and Amelita R. Superable. If you can see, my last name is 
                    not quite familiar. It is because my father is from Jaro Leyte in Visayas and my mother is from Ilocos Sur. They are blessed with four children, 
                    and guess what? I'm the youngest. My brother, Michael Ervin R. Superable, is the oldest. He is such a strong and responsible son to my mama and papa and brother to us.
                    He is already working and sharing his blessings with us. The second to the oldest is my beautiful sister, Angela May R. Superable. She is strong and independent. She is 
                    also currently working and she's a giver. She always shares what she has with us. Last but not least, our future architect in the family, Hannah Grace R. Superable. 
                    She is kind and smart. She's still studying here at the University of the Northern Philippines.

                    Let me tell you something. When I was a kid, they called me negro. Negro means "black handsome guy". So for me, 
                    I was so happy when they called me negro, then they always started laughing. Then I was just chillin' peacefully. 
                    I am a jolly brave man. When we came to Ilocos after my father's burial, we were very sad, and we had no friends at that time. 
                    After a year living in my mother's hometown, I started making friends in our neighborhood. I had a few friends at the time, 
                    and then we started making more and more. Our group is called TROPA and started at that time. I am so happy because we are growing 
                    together in the same neighborhood. When I was 10, I started to like playing basketball. Then, every time it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon, 
                    we went to the court and played with my tropa. Then it all started that time when I continued playing until now, and now I am part of the basketball team in our barangay. 
                    I'm so thankful to God because He gave me this kind of talent.
                </p>

                    God also showers me with some talent in singing. But I'm not a performer. I also like doing role playing because I love how I make people 
                    laugh and smile when they see me acting in front of them. I'm also thankful to God for giving me such a beautiful and wonderful family who keeps 
                    supporting me in all I want to achieve. I always got their back and stuck together, even on our worst days and happy days.
